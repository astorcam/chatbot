# Chatbot
A little chatbot made by intents json file and IA.
The intents.json file contains a bunch of tags, not too many, but enough to have a small-talk (actually, the chatbot's language is in Spanish).

STEPS:
1. Donwload the files.
2. Run tranning.py
3. Run chatbot.py
4. Start chatting

I used the following libraries:
-pickle
-nltk
-numpy
-tensorflow

It's a small proyect made just to learn about machine learning, bag of words, etc.
